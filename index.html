          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human 
            intelligence in machines, enabling them to learn, reason, 
            and solve problems. 
            It powers technologies like chatbots, self-driving cars, and 
            recommendation systems. AI uses techniques such as machine 
            learning and deep learning to analyze data, recognize patterns,
            and make decisions with minimal human intervention. As AI continues
            to evolve, it is transforming industries, improving efficiency, 
            and reshaping how we interact with technology. I hold a master’s 
            degree in Artificial Intelligence, which has given me a deep 
            understanding of AI principles, algorithms, and applications.
            My expertise allows me to develop AI-driven solutions, 
            optimize machine learning models, and explore innovative ways
            to leverage AI for real-world challenges.

            A software engineer designs, develops, tests,
            and maintains software applications, ensuring 
            they run efficiently and meet user needs. 
            Their work involves writing clean, scalable code, 
            debugging issues, and collaborating with teams to 
            create innovative solutions. Key skills include
             programming languages (such as Python, Java, 
             or JavaScript), problem-solving, algorithm design, 
             and understanding databases and cloud technologies. 
             Additionally, software engineers must be adaptable, 
             continuously learning new tools and frameworks to 
             keep up with the evolving tech industry. Their role 
             is essential in building everything from web 
             applications to AI systems, shaping the digital 
             world we live in today. I hold a bachelor's degree 
             in Computer Science, which has provided me with 
             a strong foundation in software development, 
             algorithms, and system design. My academic background, 
             combined with hands-on experience, allows me to create 
             efficient and scalable software solutions tailored 
             to modern technological demands.

          <h5 class="features__header">Web development</h5>
          <p>
            Web development is the process of creating and maintaining 
            websites and web applications. It involves front-end 
            development, which focuses on user interfaces using 
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development,
             which manages server-side logic, databases, and APIs. 
             Full-stack developers work on both aspects. 
             Web development enables businesses, organizations, 
             and individuals to establish an online presence, 
             offering interactive and dynamic experiences. 
             With evolving technologies like React, Node.js, 
             and cloud computing, web development continues to 
             shape the digital world. I have created a few websites, 
             applying my knowledge of front-end and back-end development 
             to build functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing 
             platforms. These projects have strengthened my skills in 
             designing responsive layouts, optimizing performance, 
             and integrating various web technologies to enhance user
              experience.

          <p>
            I play both piano and guitar, and each instrument 
            brings a unique joy to my musical journey. 
            The piano allows me to explore rich harmonies, 
            intricate melodies, and deep emotions, 
            while the guitar gives me the freedom to express 
            rhythm and energy in a more hands-on, 
            dynamic way. Whether I’m playing soft, soulful 
            piano chords or strumming lively guitar riffs, 
            music is a huge part of who I am. Both instruments 
            complement each other, allowing me 
            to experiment with different styles, compose my 
            own music, and continuously grow as a musician.
